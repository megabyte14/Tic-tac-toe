💡 Tic Tac Toe Tron Edition

A neon-style, Player vs Computer Tic Tac Toe game built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, inspired by Tron aesthetics.

1. _**Project Overview**_

This project started as a console-based Java game (Player vs Computer) and was later recreated as a web-based interactive game with a modern neon UI.

The goal was to build a playable game with:

➡️ Player vs computer AI

➡️ Reset functionality

➡️ Full browser-based interactivity without requiring any server backend




2. _**Technologies Used**_

➡️ HTML: Structure of the game board, buttons, and status text

➡️ CSS: Neon Tron-style design for buttons, board, and text effects

➡️ Bootstrap: Used for a styled reset button with neon glow

➡️ JavaScript: Handles all game logic, including player moves, computer AI, win/draw detection, and board reset



3. _**How I Built the Web Version**_
HTML

➡️ Created a 3×3 grid of buttons for the game board

➡️ Added a reset button




CSS

➡️ Added dark background for the neon effect

➡️ Styled buttons and text with neon glow

➡️ Added hover animations

➡️ Styled the reset button with glowing effect



JavaScript

➡️ Maintains a board array to track moves

➡️ Handles click events for player moves

➡️ Runs computer AI after player turn

➡️ Updates status message and checks for win/draw

➡️ Implements reset functionality




Integration

➡️ HTML loads the CSS and JS files

➡️ Fully browser-based — no backend required

➡️ Runs instantly by opening index.html


NOTE: Although the final project runs entirely in the browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the repository still includes the original Java console-based implementation. This Java file is retained intentionally, as it contains the core game algorithm and logic around which the project was built, and serves as a reference for the original design and decision-making process.
